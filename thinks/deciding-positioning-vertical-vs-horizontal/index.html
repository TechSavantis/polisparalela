<p>When clients come to us for help with their brand identity, they&rsquo;ve often already done lots of thinking about what the brief should be.</p>

<p>This is certainly valuable, and an important step in the process, but before you think about your brand brief, there&rsquo;s something even more important you need to figure out.</p>

<p>You need to know what your <em>positioning</em> is.</p>

<h2 id="what-s-positioning">What&rsquo;s positioning?</h2>

<p>Your positioning is where you sit in the mind of your customer, and what they perceive they&rsquo;ll get from you that they can&rsquo;t get from your competitors.</p>

<p>If your positioning&rsquo;s <em>weak</em>, you&rsquo;re going to struggle to been seen as different. You&rsquo;re going to be fighting to stand out from the crowd.</p>

<p><img src="images/blog/shutterstock_278349737.jpg" alt="" title="Ah, there it is. Obligatory dodgy stock photo showing a crowd. From which you don't stand out." /></p>

<p>The danger is you either spend a lot of time trying but failing to win customers, or have to compete on price, and no-one wants to go down that road.</p>

<p>But with <em>strong</em> positioning you can stand out, be seen as an expert, and as a result charge a premium for your services.</p>

<p><em>So, how do you establish your positioning?</em></p>

<h2 id="vertical-positioning">Vertical positioning</h2>

<p>Vertical positioning is where you focus on a particular classification or type of business - like health care companies or financial advisers or architects or holiday companies.</p>

<p>For example, you might be accountants specialising in working with health care companies, and you focus your marketing on reaching that industry.</p>

<h2 id="horizontal-positioning">Horizontal positioning</h2>

<p>Horizontal positioning works across many business types, but is identified in other ways, usually by demographics, or the discipline you offer.</p>

<p>For example, you might be a marketing company that works in many different business sectors, but focuses on the youth market, or the Asian market.</p>

<p>Or you specialise in a particular discipline. You might be the best designer of branded furniture; you work for many different types of business, but you&rsquo;re the best damn branded-furniture designer there is.</p>

<p>In summary, when comparing vertical and horizontal, you could say:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Vertical is the market, horizontal is the demographic or discipline.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="the-advantages-of-vertical-positioning">The advantages of vertical positioning</h2>

<p>The first advantage of vertical positioning is that it&rsquo;s easier to find prospects.</p>

<p>Most of the business world is orientated around vertical positioning. It&rsquo;s easy to buy a list of all architects, or all financial advisers. You&rsquo;ll also find it easy to identify conferences or industry-specific publications you can target.</p>

<p><img src="images/blog/shutterstock_685130050.jpg" alt="" title="Trade shows for particular sectors or types of business are easy to find" /></p>

<p>The second advantage is that you can benefit from decision-makers that move to a new job.</p>

<p>People change jobs more frequently now, and when they move on, they tend to go to a similar position within the same industry. So if you follow your contact, there&rsquo;s a good chance you&rsquo;ll keep the client they were working at before, AND pick up the new client they&rsquo;ve just gone to.</p>

<p>Third, you can develop your expertise in your customers&rsquo; specific type of business, which makes it easier to know what to say to new prospects when you find them (or they find you).</p>

<p>When you can talk competently in their language, and give examples of what you&rsquo;ve done for others with the same problems, your prospect sees real value in what you offer.</p>

<p>The final advantage of vertical positioning is that it&rsquo;s usually more highly compensated, because you become the go-to for that client.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s great if you can offer them lots of services and get paid for them, but not so good if you need to start farming work out to others.</p>

<h2 id="the-advantages-of-horizontal-positioning">The advantages of horizontal positioning</h2>

<p>The first advantage with horizontal positioning is that you get a more varied and interesting mix of clients. Who wants to only ever work with Estate Agents for the rest of the lives, right?</p>

<p>But the drawback of variety is in finding your prospects.</p>

<p>Where do you go to look for your new clients? You no longer have the option of simply buying a list, and although there are some exceptions, it&rsquo;s harder to spot the places they&rsquo;ll all hang out, or the things they&rsquo;ll all read.</p>

<p>The second advantage of horizontal positioning is that you don&rsquo;t get a conflict of interest where you have more than one client in a particular market. If you&rsquo;re the expert in <em>say</em> search marketing for accountants, you can&rsquo;t get all your clients to the number one spot, can you?</p>

<p>But there&rsquo;s a counter-argument here - if you&rsquo;ve got lots of clients in one industry, and you&rsquo;re established as a true expert in that industry, surely your new client&rsquo;s going to be more attracted to your expertise than worried about a conflict of interest?</p>

<p>A third advantage is that you&rsquo;re better protected in a downturn. If you specialise in the motor industry, and that industry suddenly spirals downwards, you&rsquo;re going down with them. But if you&rsquo;re spread across multiple markets, you&rsquo;re protecting yourself against that risk.</p>

<p><img src="images/blog/shutterstock_481260550.jpg" alt="" title="Positioning horizontally means you haven't got all your eggs in one market-sector basket" /></p>

<p>The fourth big advantage with horizontal positioning is that you&rsquo;ve got more chance of working with bigger clients (with bigger budgets) on something specific.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say a big company needs help with some very specific training for their management team, and you happen to be the best at delivering that type of training, they&rsquo;ll come to you and pay you handsomely for it.</p>

<p>Sure, they&rsquo;ll have other suppliers doing other stuff for them, but that can be ok, can&rsquo;t it? You get called in to do the thing you&rsquo;re brilliant at, and you can get paid very nicely for it.</p>

<h2 id="which-is-better">Which is better?</h2>

<p>You can probably tell from this post that positioning vertically or horiozontally both have their merits, so it kind of depends on what you want to get from your business.</p>

<p>Many business tend towards horizontal by instinct. Partly in fear of narrowing their potential market, and partly because they want variety in their work.</p>

<p>My advice?</p>

<p>Look at horizontal positioning first and see whether you can be sure you know how to find your customers.</p>

<p>If you can see how to find them, stick with that, but if you can&rsquo;t, switch to looking at positioning yourselves vertically instead.</p>

<h2 id="is-it-possible-to-be-both-vertically-and-horizontally-positioned">Is it possible to be both vertically and horizontally positioned?</h2>

<p>Yes, absolutely - and when that happens, you&rsquo;re going to have a very clear target audience.</p>

<p>The advantage here is that you can be very specific. Think of it like cross hairs on a sight (which is where literally the horizontal and vertical meet) and you have the perfect means of aiming straight at your target.</p>

<p>The disadvantage is if you feel your pool of potential customers might be too small, but if not, it can be a great situation to be in because you&rsquo;re position and message is so specific.</p>

<h2 id="so-you-ve-got-your-positioning-nailed-now-what">So you&rsquo;ve got your positioning nailed. Now what?</h2>

<p>Whatever you decide, your positioning has to be public. The point is for your customer to understand how you&rsquo;re different to everyone else, and why they should work with you.</p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t make your position very public, and very clearly stated, how will they know?</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s as bad as not having a position in the first place.</p>
