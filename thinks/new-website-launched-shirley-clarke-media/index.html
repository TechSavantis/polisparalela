<p><a href="https://www.shirleyclarke-education.org/">Shirley Clarke</a> is the foremost expert on the practical application of formative assessment - which is a range of procedures carried out by teachers during the learning process to improve kids&rsquo; attainment.</p>

<p>She began her career as a primary school teacher, before becoming a maths consultant and then a lecturer and researcher at the Institute of Education, University of London. She&rsquo;s now a freelance consultant running courses and researching and writing about best practices in education. So she knows her stuff.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve been working with Shirley for over eight years, building one of her first websites, before adding ecommerce functionality and an online booking system for her courses.</p>

<h2 id="unique-video-content">Unique video content</h2>

<p>One of the ways she helps teachers with their professional development is by recording and sharing video of formative assessment in action in real classrooms, both in the UK and the US.</p>

<p>These clips used to be available on a DVD that schools could order online from her old website. But technology moved on and DVDs became less popular, and at the start of 2016 we were asked to develop a subscription-based video platform as a new way to deliver this unique content.</p>

<p>During our initial discussions with Shirley and husband John, it became clear the design of the site also needed looking at, and so the project was expanded to include a full redesign, to bring the site up to scratch and maximise the success of the video platform.</p>

<h2 id="our-approach">Our approach</h2>

<p>We decided to tackle this project using our recently updated approach, working more iteratively so the planning, design and development combined and evolved as the project took shape.</p>

<p>This helped us figure out the best structure for the site from the user&rsquo;s point of view, and made it easier for the client to see how things worked.</p>

<p>In turn, this made them feel more involved right the way through the project.</p>

<h2 id="planning">Planning</h2>

<p>The project kicked off with a meeting with the client, <a href="/is/mike-vine/">Creative Director Mike</a>, <a href="/is/trys-mudford/">Lead Developer Trys</a> and <a href="/is/mark-vaesen/">me</a> discussing in lots of detail who would be using the site and how they&rsquo;d find their way around. We also talked about what content would be on the site - both now and in the future - and how it would need to be managed.</p>

<p>From this meeting I worked on a site structure. I started out with a bunch of hand-written page names on post-its, stuck to our meeting room table. This low-tech starting point enables me to easily move things around, sticking and re-sticking, to find the best overall structure. I took shots on my phone to record my thought process.</p>

<p><img src="images/blog/shirley-clarke-post-its.jpg" alt="" title="Low-tech solution to working out site structure" /></p>

<p>Once I was happy with the structure, I worked up our usual Project Plan document, which sets out the functionality of the different parts of the site.</p>

<p>After several more discussions with the client, we settled on a first draft for us to use for the initial design stage.</p>

<h2 id="design">Design</h2>

<p>Creative Director <a href="/is/mike-vine/">Mike Vine</a> used two key tools to create concepts for the key pages of the site. Here he describes his approach to the design of the site;</p>


	<blockquote class="post-preview content">
		<h2>“I use Sketch and InVision together for rapid prototyping.”</h2>
		<cite>&mdash; Mike Vine, Creative Director at Polis Paralela</cite>
	</blockquote>



<p>&ldquo;As with most projects, I used <a href="https://www.sketchapp.com">Sketch</a> for my initial designs, before importing them into <a href="https://www.invisionapp.com">InVision</a>. I use these two tools together for rapid prototyping, so I can present designs the client can quickly get their heads round.</p>

<p><img src="images/blog/invision-1024x623.png" alt="" title="Mike used InVision for prototyping" /></p>

<p>It was crucial the redesign was in keeping with the client&rsquo;s core values - we couldn&rsquo;t go bananas with something completely wild that might alienate the target audience. Prior to the redesign of the website, Shirley had been working with another designer on some changes to the colour palette she used, so this was another key consideration I had to work with.</p>

<p>The overall aim of the site was to offer a more interactive experience, with the main focus on getting users to the right video clip as quickly as possible. I wanted a simple and clean navigation, and worked hard at getting the design elements stripped back as far as possible, to speed up navigation and the user journey.</p>

<p>Presenting the design concepts face-to-face using InVision helps the client understand how a user moves between different parts of the site, and I was delighted that Shirley and John bought into our ideas so completely. You can&rsquo;t beat the feeling of when a client loves your work and sees what you&rsquo;ve set out to achieve.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As a key part of the design process we also wrote the copy required for the mock-ups Mike worked on. I worked closely with Shirley to establish the right tone for the various calls to action, buttons and bullet list descriptions, before working with Mike to make sure the copy worked with his designs, and vice versa.</p>

<p>No <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/01/lorem-ipsum-killing-designs/">Lorem Ipsum</a> here.</p>

<h2 id="build">Build</h2>

<p>Once the overall concept and look and feel of the site was established, Mike did a bunch of other mock-ups so our Lead Developer Trys had a complete set of designs to work from.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In order to maximise the content prioritisation - in other words, what content was most important - I developed the site mobile first. I find this is much more effective than working desktop-down.</p>

<p>We used WooCommerce Subscriptions to power the membership features of the site, which very nicely handles registration, renewals and the other bits and pieces we needed. The video clips are hosted via a third party system and we needed to find something that was unlikely to be blocked by a significant number of schools. The old standbys of Youtube or Vimeo fall foul of these sort of restrictions. After much research, we settled on Vzaar, which is stable and cost-effective and offers a range of price points that suited the budget.</p>

<p><img src="images/blog/VZaar-1024x480.png" alt="" title="Video clips are handled by Vzaar" /></p>

<p>During the development, quite a bit of time was spent fine-tuning the related content on both the Video and Research sections to make sure the user has relevant options of where to go next. We went through several iterations and I worked closely with Mike for his design input as we went along.</p>

<p>By the same process, we slimmed the checkout process down in order to speed up and simplify the user journey through this part of the site. After all, you don&rsquo;t want to throw up barriers to sign up when you&rsquo;ve got them that far, do you?&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="populating-the-site-and-the-testing-feedback-loop">Populating the site, and the testing/feedback loop</h2>

<p>The job of populating the site, including adding just under 100 video clips and seven years of research, fell to Junior Developer Kieran Karn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Action Research section of the site probably presented the biggest challenge, as this section of the current site - where I was taking it from - was in a bit of a mess. It took me about three days to get all the content in place.</p>

<p><img src="images/blog/Videos-section-border-1024x602.png" alt="" title="Great care was taken over selecting individual thumbnail images, and making sure clips were in strict correct order" /></p>

<p>&ldquo;After I&rsquo;d added the content and tested it, we decided the &ldquo;Filter by age&rdquo; feature was too broad and difficult for users to understand, so we changed it. Having the content already in place made this easier as we could see what filtering worked; we decided that combining age groups was the way forward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I worked closely with Mike when adding the video clips, as he needed to choose a suitable thumbnail for each one. The clips also needed to be ordered in strict accordance with the client&rsquo;s requirements (otherwise they wouldn&rsquo;t have made sense) and tagged properly for filtering.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Once all the content was in place, I worked with Trys through the testing, working through the subscription service in a &ldquo;live&rdquo; mode to ensure everything worked as it should, and testing the entire site on a variety of devices.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="what-the-client-said">What the client said</h2>

<p>After the site had been live for a couple of weeks, we asked Shirley and John how they thought the project had gone.</p>

<p><em>So, how was it for you? How smoothly did you find the whole process of the project?</em></p>

<p>Very positive! From concept to completion, the team was creative, efficient, easy to work with and often knew what we wanted and needed better than we did.</p>

<p><em>Before the project started, which bit were you most worried about?</em></p>

<p>Before we started, the bit we we were most concerned about was that the technology would actually work. We&rsquo;d never developed an online video streaming platform before and knew very little about how it would all function for the user subscribers and for ourselves with the behind-the-scenes admin tools.</p>

<p><em>How did you feel about the process Polis Paralela took?</em></p>

<p>Having worked with Polis Paralela before on less ambitious projects, we had a great comfort level that they had the expertise to take us and our ideas through a thorough process of first determining what would be a quality end result and working towards that in a logical way.</p>

<p><em>Which bit of the project did you find the hardest?</em></p>

<p>The most difficult part of the project was learning to grasp the technology needed and how to exploit that to meet our goals. But is was all explained and demonstrated in digestible bits so we could get our heads round it.</p>

<p><em>There were three main people leading the project - Mark, Mike and Trys - and all of them were involved pretty much all along the way. Would it have been easier having just one person to deal with?</em></p>

<p>Working with three main people was far preferable to having just one point of contact. The overall project was led by Mark, who managed our idea by sharing and shaping everything with us and his creative and technical people so that we could participate with the same vision.</p>

<p>The end result is a beautiful looking, redesigned website with a video streaming platform that is well-crafted and works. The product is worth every penny. And the continuing support is solid and readily available when we need it.</p>
