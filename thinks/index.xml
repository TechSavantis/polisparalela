      <description>What we did • Digital Marketing
• Social Media
• Paid Social
The brief Cade Street Nursery is a family business based in Heathfield, East Sussex, and they have been growing plants and flowers there since the 1980s.
“Polis Paralela responded to the challenge of the targets set within the project and really got behind our business. Targets were exceeded and this resulted in a good uplift in sales.” &amp;mdash; Rob Honeysett, Cade Street Nursery Sales &amp;amp; Planning Manager  Polis Paralela had previously developed a website for them in 2014.</description>

      <description>There are times in your business life when certain things stay the same for a long time.
You tread the path you’ve chosen, working in a way that’s familiar and well-honed, and you feel comfortable.
Then there are times when massive changes happen.
The last twelve months for me has definitely been the latter.
The Rut In January 2018, Polis Paralela was five years old. The business had always been stable and profitable, and we’d enjoyed steady if unspectacular growth.</description>

      <description>2018 marks the third incarnation of Paul the Octopus, our World Cup predictions game created in homage to the mystic mollusc.
It&amp;rsquo;s a fun little tournament that we run every other year, as both an internal and a wider-reaching contest.
The rules are pretty simple: predict the score for each game. A correct score nets you 3 points, a correct result gets 1 point. There are also a few challenges along the way to earn some bonus points.</description>

      <description>On the 1st May 2018, we launched the latest Polis Paralela website. To represent our change in business approach and new brand, the site was designed to be confident, clear and quick. Confidence meant stripping away the fluff, leaving only the clearest message possible.
This ethos was applied to the brand, copy and site design — so it was only natural for it to extend to the development, and this focus lead to great performance.</description>

      <description>With today being ‘International Jazz Day’, I thought it was the perfect chance to share some of Steve’s recent work and blogs, where he does a deep dive into what he calls “a labour of love and typography“.
In an attempt to to test his layout chops and partly to learn and explore new technologies and techniques in both HTML and CSS, he set off trying to recreate responsive versions of iconic jazz album covers!</description>

      <description>How do you provide retail staff around the world with high-quality training for a product that’s growing exponentially? We’ve been working with Agon Systems for a number of years; creating their brand identity, designing and building their website, leading their digital marketing strategy, creating exhibition stands, stationery and presentation boxes, and most recently, building a single-page website for one of their biggest distribution products: Concept Tag.
The Concept Tag is a new type of retail security tag that is revolutionising the industry.</description>

      <description>As someone that takes runs social media marketing efforts for a number of accounts across a variety of platforms, I always like finding ways of making the administrative side a bit easier.
One particular bugbear of mine has been with Instagram. As a rule, Instagram is quite ‘locked down’ compared to Facebook, Twitter and suchlike – for example, there’s little-to-no API access, meaning scheduling posts can be difficult.
Another thing I’ve found a bit of pain was that, although you can view your Instagram feed on desktop (although Instagram Stories was only a recent addition to this), actually posting images from non-mobile devices is a PITA.</description>

      <title>How to significantly improve the performance of your WordPress site</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/thinks/improving-wordpress-performance/</link>

      <description>As I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned before, website speed is incredibly important. Search engines are beginning to penalise slow websites, but more importantly, users are voting with their feet when it comes to slow websites. Check out this awesome infographic from KISSmetrics on how loading times affect your bottom line, it&amp;rsquo;s quite an eye-opener.
When it came to building our new website, performance was at the front of my mind. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t that performance was an issue for our previous site, rather due to changing technologies and a design involving a heavier emphasis on images and graphical content I knew that prioritising performance would be key.</description>

      <title>What is Brand Identity and why is it important to my business?</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/thinks/brand-identity-important-business/</link>

      <guid>//localhost:1313/thinks/brand-identity-important-business/</guid>
      <description>What is brand identity? Your brand identity is how you want to portray your business to your customers, and includes how you choose your business name, the design of your logo, the colours and shapes or graphics you use, and the type of language you use (your “tone of voice”).
Brand identity is different to brand image, which is the result of these efforts. I.e. a successful brand identity translates into a positive brand image.</description>

      <description>We know that investing in design is a good thing.
Research has shown that for every £1 invested in design, businesses can expect over £20 in increased revenues.
But how do you go about buying design?
The old-fashioned way, and why it’s flawed as a process I don’t know exactly when it became standard practice, but the way most businesses find an agency to help them with their brand, website or any other part of their marketing, is usually as follows:</description>

      <description>History’s cool.
Digital marketing is cool.
Can I haphazardly combine the two together?
Maybe!
Here are four occurrences throughout human history that I think reflect some key pillars of modern digital marketing and PR, as well as some useful lessons we can learn from them.
SEO – Welsh village changes name Lanff…Lanfairgwillygo…Llanfairpwlllogegllant… The vast majority of people in the UK are aware of that place in Anglesey, Wales that has the most mind-bogglingly Welsh name in creation.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re proud to announce the launch of a rapid new website for Hartwell Insurance.
The site was built with global performance as a first-priority feature. To that end, the site is built in Hugo, a static-site generator that does away with databases and the performance hit that comes from them.
By making the site static, we were able to distribute the hosting to multiple CDN servers with Netlify. This means users connect to the closest server to their location, not to a single datacenter.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s one of my favourite stories about how your branding&amp;rsquo;s very important to customers - and often in ways you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t expect.
One Wednesday morning, a junior member of the Customer Services team took a phone call at the Macclesfield store of renowned department store Arighi Bianchi.
&amp;ldquo;Good morning, this is Arighi Bianchi. How can I help you?&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;I want to make a complaint.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m sorry to hear that madam, but I can certainly help.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a couple of great stories about stupidity.
The first story concerns a friend who&amp;rsquo;s a GP.
One day a few years ago, a middle-aged woman turned up at her surgery feeling lousy. She had no energy, bad headaches and her limbs were aching.
She was convinced she had Lyme disease and proceeded to instruct the doctor to prescribe her the antibiotic amoxicillin.
Of course, my doctor friend insisted on a proper consultation and suspected the lady probably just had flu.</description>

      <guid>//localhost:1313/thinks/moving-dev-test-os-x-dnsmasq/</guid>
      <description>It finally happened. After buying the .dev TLD a couple of years ago, Google have finally started doing something with it. The first step has arrived in Chrome 63, which hit my browser at 13:36 on the 14th December. All http:// requests are automatically redirected to https://. This change has broken the local development setup on my Mac.
Although a valiant step in the direction of local SSL development, I&amp;rsquo;m not clued up enough with self-signed certificates to implement that, especially not a week before breaking up for Christmas.</description>

      <description>When clients come to us for help with their brand identity, they&amp;rsquo;ve often already done lots of thinking about what the brief should be.
This is certainly valuable, and an important step in the process, but before you think about your brand brief, there&amp;rsquo;s something even more important you need to figure out.
You need to know what your positioning is.
What&amp;rsquo;s positioning? Your positioning is where you sit in the mind of your customer, and what they perceive they&amp;rsquo;ll get from you that they can&amp;rsquo;t get from your competitors.</description>

      <description>A college education in the US costs about $25,000 a year on average. Most students need to work pretty hard to support themselves over the four years it takes to get a degree, but here&amp;rsquo;s how one guy supported himself through his entire college education working only a few hours a week, by knowing how to influence how people make decisions.
How did he do it?
He sold cars. But not in a showroom or car lot.</description>

      <description>A personalised card manufacturer (with a &amp;rsquo;pork-related&amp;rsquo; name) have recently rebranded with a swanky new site. The brand is a huge step forward and there&amp;rsquo;s some really nice parts to the online shop.
As part of the fun new brand direction, they&amp;rsquo;ve created some &amp;lsquo;hyper-illustrated&amp;rsquo; buttons, a style which is pretty popular at the moment. Unfortunately, these buttons were created with images.
Not the end of the world I hear you cry, sometimes the design requires an image!</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;But I don&amp;rsquo;t like green. Can we try it in another colour?&amp;rdquo;
This was what a client said to us, a couple of years ago, when we presented our concept for his new brand identity.
It seems like an understandable response and a reasonable request, right?
The client was in financial services, and was setting up a new business venture. He&amp;rsquo;d come to us because he had nothing - no brand, no printed collateral, no website, not even a name - and he wanted to give his start-up the best chance of being a success by investing what was (for him) quite a bit of money in the development of his brand.</description>

      <description>Earlier this month I attended my fourth edition BrightonSEO conference - another great day that left me walking back up to Brighton station with my head brimming with ideas!
Once again I find myself reflecting on how incredibly fortunate it is that this fantastic resource is just a few stops on the train away. People come by plane, train and automobile to what is now Europe&amp;rsquo;s largest SEO conference, so being able to have a bit of a lie-in and still be there for the 10am start is an absolute luxury!</description>

      <description>If I gave you a magic wand and said you could wish for your perfect customer, what would you wish for?
Our perfect customer would look something like this:
 Established, profitable business Looking to move to the next level Sensible budget (£5,000 for a brand, £10,000 - £20,000 for a website, at least £1,500 a month for their digital marketing) Sees the value of investing in good design Doesn&amp;rsquo;t have an in-house marketing team, or person  How to identify your perfect customer When you&amp;rsquo;re figuring out what your ideal customer looks like, you need to ask yourself questions like:</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve just published an article on Dev.to, an online development community.
It outlines the problems with percentage margins and provides a solution using pixel margins whilst keeping the percentage grid. By using the fixed-gutter calculation, you can easily enforce vertical &amp;amp; horizontal consistency throughout a CSS grid.

      <description>Hi there, I’m Steve. I’m from Yorkshire and I started working at Polis Paralela in August 2016 as a Junior Web Developer.
Somewhat shamefully this is my first post for the Polis Paralela blog, though this has been percolating for some time now so hopefully you’ll find it worth the wait&amp;hellip;
As a means of introducing myself I thought I’d tell the story of my journey from Huddersfield, where I completed my Masters in Interactive Multimedia in 2004, to sitting in Polis Paralela HQ over a decade later.</description>

      <description>It amazes me how often I see clients repeatedly making the same mistakes and bad decisions when it comes to designing a new website.
The worst thing is that these errors of judgement - whether in the planning or design stages or in the way they manage the project - result in a finished site that&amp;rsquo;s nowhere near as good as it could be.
Here&amp;rsquo;s my top 5. Make sure you&amp;rsquo;re not making these mistakes too&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>The biggest and best companies in the world can spend millions of pounds trying to find that perfect image to represent their brand.
There&amp;rsquo;s thousands of examples out there, but some stand out thanks to small factors behind their design that elevate them from a standard logo to something a bit special.
1. Sony Vaio A perfect example of a logo that has an ingenious element to it, this one for Sony&amp;rsquo;s now-discontinued range of Vaio laptops uses the letter of the brand name to cleverly show the integration of the analogue and digital data transfer.</description>

The whole thing&amp;rsquo;s off. I&amp;rsquo;m going to go and sit in a corner and sulk for the next two weeks.
And all for the sake of some turkey!
Allow me to explain&amp;hellip;
Last Friday we had our Christmas meal. For the last four years or so, we&amp;rsquo;ve gone to Pelham House in Lewes, and been very happy indeed with the food and service.
But last year there was some confusion about whether we were having their Christmas menu or their standard lunch menu.</description>

      <description>Following on from my recent post on How to organise content for your website, I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed something that&amp;rsquo;s kept cropping up for discussion over recent projects - how best to organise a portfolio of projects.
The best option to take usually depends on the content available, and in particular the spread of different projects across different categories or sectors.
To give you some ideas, here are what I think are the three most common ways of organising projects:</description>

      <description>SASS is one of the most popular CSS extensions in use today. It offers a huge palette of tools for authoring scalable stylesheets including support for nesting, selector inheritance, file inclusions and scoped variables.
It&amp;rsquo;s given developers a glimpse into what writing bleeding-edge CSS could look like in a few years, safe in the knowledge that all the code will work in browsers today. And for that reason, as all SASS is processed down into CSS before the browser parses it, in many respects there isn’t anything special about it.</description>

The venue was The Duke of York’s in Brighton (Britain’s oldest working cinema) and the whole event was organised brilliantly. The seating was supremely comfortable, free tea, coffee, pastries and ice creams were provided and the diverse range of talks made for a really great conference.</description>

      <description>In June 2015, Polis Paralela finished a project to design and develop the new website for Hailsham Town Council.
Our brief was to design and develop a new website for the council to give residents easy access to council services and information about the town.
The client wanted a website that was accessible to all, and embraced the very essence of good design; something that didn’t just look good, but was easy and intuitive to use, regardless of the device being used or any impairments the user might have.</description>

      <description>In the latest in my series covering the different aspects of planning your website project, we look at what features to include on your site, and how to choose what&amp;rsquo;s best for your business.
Straight off the bat, I should tell you this is aimed at what&amp;rsquo;s historically been referred to as &amp;ldquo;brochure&amp;rdquo; websites.
Around 75% of our clients have this type of site, so it&amp;rsquo;s relevant to the majority of businesses, but if you&amp;rsquo;re looking for in-depth analysis of ecommerce features, or other more complex sites, you&amp;rsquo;re probably in the wrong place.</description>

Goodwood galleries Every September for the past 18 years, Goodwood Motor Circuit has opened its doors to 200,000+ historic racing fans to experience the Goodwood Revival, a period-style festival celebrating the racing years of Goodwood between 1948 and 1966. It’s a nostalgic and remarkably authentic throwback to mid 20th-century motorsport.
I first attended the event many years ago as a secondary school student but hadn&amp;rsquo;t been back since.</description>

This time it was held at its new home at the Brighton Centre - a testament to how popular the event has gotten since 2011, and a far cry from the back room of a pub where the first one was held!
Around three thousand search marketers were in attendance to take in a whole host of talks from an array of industry experts, and it once again proved to be a valuable experience.</description>

      <description>Research was released last month showing that a gargantuan 77 per cent of content is being shared via &amp;lsquo;dark social&amp;rsquo; channels.
For social media marketers, that&amp;rsquo;s massive. The huge amount of dark social sharing shows how people are now consuming online media – switching from channel to channel over many devices per day.
But as the title suggests, what the heck is &amp;lsquo;dark social&amp;rsquo;?
Essentially, it&amp;rsquo;s visits to your website that comes from the sharing of content on social platforms that aren&amp;rsquo;t easily quantified.</description>

      <description>With the new website now live, we continued the brand rollout for the Concept Tag with the creation of a new brochure.
The brochure was created to promote the Concept Tag; the “World’s most secure EAS Tag”. This revolutionary new product from Agon Systems eliminates illicit tag removal and is proven to reduce losses by 66%.
By obtaining a detailed brief from the client it became clear the brochure had to reinforce the key values of the product; quality, reliability and durability.</description>

      <description>Unless you&amp;rsquo;ve been living in a cave the last month or so you&amp;rsquo;ll know that next week sees the start of Euro 2016!
With it will inevitably come England&amp;rsquo;s exit in the last 16 - but here at Polis Paralela we want the fun to go on all tournament, so for the last month we&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a way to ensure that&amp;rsquo;s the case.
Enter - Paul the Octopus.</description>

      <description>So you&amp;rsquo;ve decided you need a new website, settled on the type of website you need, and created a website design brief. You&amp;rsquo;re ready to put the feelers out so you can choose a web design agency.
But how do you choose the right agency for your project?
Comparing apples with oranges Clients frequently tell me how confusing it is to choose between the different sized and shaped web design companies, especially when you get such a wide range of approaches and costs.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s get right back to basics. What is &amp;lsquo;marketing&amp;rsquo; anyway?
Generally, it&amp;rsquo;s a means of getting people or businesses to buy into whatever product or service you&amp;rsquo;re offering.
From a more academic viewpoint, the Chartered Institute of Marketing say that marketing is &amp;ldquo;the management process responsible for identifying, anticipating and satisfying customer requirements profitably.&amp;rdquo;
But how do you decide what to do to your marketing to try and leverage extra success from your efforts?</description>

      <description>Remember the turn of the year when it was rumoured that Twitter was upping its limit from 140 characters to a whopping 10,000?
Thank goodness that didn&amp;rsquo;t happen! The think-pieces were in full flow for the first couple of weeks of January, such was the drastic nature of the supposed changes. But after some backlash from a number of users, the idea was quietly dropped.
There&amp;rsquo;s a small level of satisfaction when you manage to cram everything into the strict limitations of the platform; it&amp;rsquo;s the brevity that keeps Twitter fast-paced and relevant by encouraging people to tweet in the moment the essence of what they want to communicate.</description>

      <description>For the past six months we’ve been using a website called InVision - a prototyping and collaboration tool. The concept is simple - upload the designs, share with the client and they then leave feedback.
Before we started using InVision it seemed to be a long process in reaching a final design. This used to involve a large number of emails and telephone conversations back and forth, with the client having to explain where and what they required changing.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s something that digital marketeers are having to think about more and more. When does personalisation cross over into breach of privacy?
People have pumped so much personal information into the digital sphere as social media has become an intrinsic part of their daily lives.
Cookies, browsing history, location services - it&amp;rsquo;s really no surprise that the very best marketing organisations utilise big data, automation, segmentation and personalisation to deliver the best and most relevant content to its target audiences.</description>

      <description>We host a good number of WordPress sites on our dedicated server and for the most part it&amp;rsquo;s plain sailing. However, there can be the odd time when a dubious individual will try and gain unlawful access to a site. Even though their attempts are thwarted by our policy for strong usernames and passwords, this sort of activity can cause a bit of unnecessary strain on the server.
As all web hosts will tell you, there&amp;rsquo;s always someone trying to see if you&amp;rsquo;ve left your username as &amp;lsquo;admin&amp;rsquo; and your password as&amp;hellip; you guessed it&amp;hellip; &amp;lsquo;password&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <description>I had my first experience of the amazing Brighton SEO conference on Friday – seeing as how I&amp;rsquo;ve lived down the road from Brighton most of my life, it’s pretty poor form that I&amp;rsquo;d never been to the event before&amp;hellip;
The day proved to be incredibly valuable on the whole and the Brighton Dome was absolutely packed with digital marketers from all over the UK and beyond. In fact, there were so many it was announced on the day that the next edition will take place at the much larger Brighton Centre.</description>

      <description>In a previous post I dropped an analogy at the end likening the practice of search engine optimisation to that of top-level cycling.
No, not that those who do it do so with a helping hand from a range of performance enhancing drugs&amp;hellip;it was actually to do with the philosophy of David Brailsford, former performance director of British Cycling and now manager of the very successful Team Sky:
 &amp;ldquo;The whole principle came from the idea that if you broke down everything you could think of that goes into riding a bike, and then improved it by 1%, you will get a significant increase when you put them all together.</description>

      <description>A quick round-up of the week as we pick out some of the highlights from the world of Brand, Web, and Online Marketing.
BRAND AND DESIGN: Domino&amp;rsquo;s unveil new packaging design Everyone knows that there&amp;rsquo;s never any point in just buying one Dominos – Two for Tuesdays and other such offers mean that 96% of pizzas sold in the UK by the chain go in pairs.
Designers JKR Global were given the brief to revamp the Domino&amp;rsquo;s brand packaging and produced this simple yet effective design, turning the Dominos logo into the packaging itself.</description>

      <description>Local SEO - what is it?
In an nutshell, local SEO is the process of trying to get your business noticed by people in your area conducting relevant searches.
Why is local SEO more important than ever?
Go to Google and type in ‘cinema’, ‘petrol station’, or ‘pizza’…and you&amp;rsquo;ll notice that it&amp;rsquo;ll show up with a map with pins dropped on the nearest examples of where you can find those things.</description>

      <description>In all businesses, every so often you need to be prepared to make significant changes to the way you do things.
And sometimes these changes come about quicker than you planned, but still work out for the best.
This was how it worked out at Polis Paralela when we decided to look again at how we can improve the way we deliver projects for our clients.
We recognised that as a creative agency we&amp;rsquo;ve moved on in terms of the type of projects we&amp;rsquo;re working on now, and the established way we were doing things wasn&amp;rsquo;t really working any more.</description>

      <description>As with almost every question relating to modern web development, it depends.
Ok, so now my cop-out answer&amp;rsquo;s out of the way, here are my thoughts…
In the past, I&amp;rsquo;ve steered clear of Javascript frameworks. Sure, I’ve dabbled in a bit of Angular and dipped my toes in the waters of Backbone but I’ve never used one on a client project. They’ve always been sidelined to unlaunched side-projects.
The reason for this is three-fold; 1.</description>

      <description>So you&amp;rsquo;ve decided you need a new website.
Your next step is to create a brief for the project. But before you do that, you need to work out a framework of the functionality; in other words, what type of website you need.
Lots of clients come to us without a fully developed brief, so we work with them in the planning stage to make sure everyone&amp;rsquo;s clear on what the project&amp;rsquo;s trying to achieve.</description>

      <description>Upgrading to Windows 10 can be irresistible for some people – and I’m not ashamed to say I was one of them. The night the new operating system was available I downloaded it straight onto my personal PC.
With a new super-chic look and a return of the start menu - which caused uproar when it was missing from Windows 8 - what could possibly go wrong with upgrading?
Well quite a lot actually.</description>

      <description>The dawn of HTML5 and CSS3 provided a wave of new technologies promising to change the way we build web applications. Web developer reactions to most features were similar, an initial buzz of excitement while we pondered the possibilities brought forth by these shiny new techniques followed by a crushing sense of disappointment when we realised just how long it would be before we could start using them.
Some crest-of-the-wave developers renounced any form of support to older browsers and pressed on with the new features.</description>

      <description>One of the most important steps in planning a new website is understanding who&amp;rsquo;s going to be using it.
The best way to work this out is to create personas.
What are personas? A persona is a representation of a type of user of your website.
But unlike vague descriptions that are easy to forget, personas are based on real people, with personalities that outline a user’s background and their reasons for using the website.</description>

      <description>A couple of weeks ago I was reading a great blog post by Adam Fairhead and there was something he said that perfectly summed up what a &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; website must do.
His comment was in his introduction to a piece about UX mistakes that make users feel stupid and was - in my opinion - bang on the money.
I found myself nodding in agreement to each of his points, and felt his summary deserved not only a closer look, but also an explanation for those who might be planning a new website, so they can make sure when it&amp;rsquo;s finished it gets top marks.</description>

The exhausting pastime of speed networking Have you ever been speed networking? It&amp;rsquo;s like speed dating, but for businesses.
Around 50 nervous-looking people get split into two groups, with one half stationed at tables scattered around a hotel conference room, and the other half are on the move, spending two minutes talking to each new &amp;ldquo;partner&amp;rdquo; before a whistle blows (I kid you not), and moving on to their next potential new-best-friend.</description>

 But it turns out that if you want your copy to be more widely read - by more people and in more detail - you need to simplify it.</description>

      <description>Ever wondered what the difference is between a logo and a brand identity?
Last week we completed a new brand identity for a Sussex payroll specialist based just up the road in nearby Uckfield.
Our client - Pay Assist We were approached by Pay Assist - an outsourced payroll services company based in Uckfield - in January to design and develop the brand identity.
It was clear from the outset that Pay Assist was a client that didn&amp;rsquo;t just need a logo throwing together.</description>

      <description>Continuing in the &amp;lsquo;How to speed up your website&amp;rsquo; series, I&amp;rsquo;m going to outline the benefits of using SVG to display images. SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics and they&amp;rsquo;re used to display vector-based images via code.
Images via code? What is this black magic? Generally created by design programs like Illustrator and Sketch, SVGs are light-weight XML files that a web browser can parse and render an image from.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m going to let you in on a little secret that will help your online marketing campaign be successful AND save you time into the bargain.
I&amp;rsquo;m going to tell you all about Evergreen Content.
What is evergreen content? So what is this magical ingredient that makes your content marketing campaign so successful?
Well it&amp;rsquo;s nothing to do with trees, and it&amp;rsquo;s nothing to do with colours. Evergreen content refers to an article (usually a blog post) that doesn&amp;rsquo;t age or date quickly, or at least isn&amp;rsquo;t short-lived; it stays relevant for a long time - it stays &amp;ldquo;evergreen&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Everyone knows writing content can be challenging, and writing long form content can be even more so. And whilst it may seem easier to write a series of shorter posts, if done correctly there are numerous benefits to be had from writing a longer piece.
Long form content is generally defined as a page or post that clocks up over 1,200 words. There are no set rules for what the post should cover, however typically it is in the form of a story or a more detailed explanation of a subject and may be about a hot topic within your industry or a breakdown of how you tackled a project.</description>

Today Birchbox has over 400,000 customers paying £10 each month to receive a goodie bag of samples in the post - and the customers don&amp;rsquo;t even get to choose what they get.</description>

But&amp;hellip;
We&amp;rsquo;ve seen several common mistakes made during the project brief stage that you should be careful to avoid. True, some of these border on the comical - but some of them are very easy traps to fall into.</description>

      <description>An important change has been made to the regulations for selling online.
From 13 June 2014 the Consumer Contracts Regulations came into effect.
The regulations apply to items bought online, at a distance, or away from a trader&amp;rsquo;s premises (for example, at home or at work). As a result, if you sell online via an ecommerce website, you will be affected by these regulations.
They replace the Distance Selling Regulations (as well as the Doorstep Selling Regulations).</description>

Header The header section of the site has taken on the most obvious change, many items have been dropped from the main navigation, the sub-navigation has been removed from below the main navigation bar and the top navigation section has been slimmed down and converted to a more subtle white backed section with the inverted BBC logo.</description>

      <description>Whether you&amp;rsquo;ve simply renamed a page or moved your entire website, it&amp;rsquo;s impossible to deny the importance of a redirect. By setting up a redirect you provide a massive benefit for your users as they will be taken to the new address instantaneously without having to lift a finger. On top of that is the transfer of search engine rankings, which is paramount if you intend to keep a strong presence in search results.</description>

      <description>They say you get what you pay for in life, and it&amp;rsquo;s certainly true when talking about your website. But what a lot of people struggle to get their heads round is what difference you&amp;rsquo;ll get by spending a bit more. In this post, we look at five key differences you should expect to get by paying that little bit more for your website.
Time is money Most of these differences require additional time to be poured into the project, and being a service-industry, this will usually directly affect the cost; most agencies will calculate the cost of a project as Hours Required x Hourly Rate = Cost.</description>

There are lots of different ingredients that can make up your online marketing cocktail and you need to judge the quantities of each to get something that&amp;rsquo;s just right for you.
For some, pay-per-click and good ol&amp;rsquo; search engine optimisation (SEO) might be the dominant flavours.</description>

      <description>The way we interact with the web is changing fast. We browse on mobile phones, tablets, laptops and desktops; even watches are getting smarter. It’s only natural that the content we publish and the way it is displayed should develop at the same rate. Unfortunately that’s not the case with many websites. Older sites (and sadly an alarming number of new websites) struggle to keep pace with the number of devices that view them; they just can’t adapt on a device by device basis.</description>

      <description>I think it’s fair to say that everyone hates a slow website. As internet speeds have increased over time, so has the amount of dynamic content being loaded into the browser and sadly that takes time to download. Furthermore, mobile usage is constantly increasing and catering for the slow speeds of mobile internet should be high on our agendas as developers.
A slow website can even harm your search position; in 2010 Google started using page load time as a factor in their rankings.</description>

      <description>This week, following a swift u-turn after a fans&amp;rsquo; backlash, Everton Football Club launched its NEW new brand identity. This is the latest example in the last few months of a high profile company re-brand that has drawn criticism from both the design community and the brand&amp;rsquo;s own customers.
But it&amp;rsquo;s not right to just dismiss a new brand without knowing the brief. How can you judge the success of a rebrand if you don&amp;rsquo;t know what it&amp;rsquo;s trying to achieve?</description>

      <description>When it comes to choosing a content management platform for your website, there are a good number to choose from. And it’s an important decision; the choice dictates how well your website will work for you. Drupal, Joomla, Perch, MODX and our personal favourite, Wordpress are just a few of the possible systems you could employ to deliver a great website. But which one is right for you?

      <description>Our summer party is the latest step in the process of rebranding as Polis Paralela. Since we decided to create a new company from the merger of our two previous businesses, we&amp;rsquo;ve had to carefully plan how to tell everyone about Polis Paralela without alienating our existing customers.
How to roll out a new brand identity In case you missed it, we have already blogged about how we created our new brand identity before we started trading in January 2013.</description>

Before we merged to become Polis Paralela, both Blue Planet and Jupiter Colour were formed as website design companies, but now we&amp;rsquo;re about so much more than that. Our &amp;ldquo;vision&amp;rdquo; for Polis Paralela was to be the best brand identity design, website design and online marketing company in Sussex.</description>

      <description>Today we revisit the launch of the new Raystede animal welfare charity website.
Back in 2011, we were commissioned to undertake a complete website design and development for Raystede, a Sussex-based animal welfare charity. In June of that year the website design was signed off, and here we revisit that key stage of the project, which was completed later that year.
The final design The final design for the website was approved with only one or two tweaks required by the client.</description>

      <description>Time for a rant. Here are some of the things that really gets our goat about website design. Make sure you don&amp;rsquo;t fall into these traps&amp;hellip;
We&amp;rsquo;re often asked to take a look at websites and give our views on what could be improved. Whilst we don&amp;rsquo;t like to put other web designers down (it&amp;rsquo;s really not our style), there are some examples of really bad design that really wind us up.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve all heard the cliches about planning - &amp;ldquo;If you don&amp;rsquo;t know where you want to go, how do you know which route to take?&amp;ldquo;or maybe &amp;ldquo;Failing to plan is planning to fail&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you&amp;rsquo;re thinking about your new website, these well-worn quotes are worth paying attention to.  If you don&amp;rsquo;t take the time to think about what your website is for and what you are trying to achieve, there&amp;rsquo;s a really good chance of messing it up.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Following on from the announcement of the arrival of Polis Paralela in our previous blog post, we are now able to reveal the new brand identity for the company.
In this post, we wanted to take the opportunity to not only show you the final brand identity design, but also to describe in detail the process we followed to achieve the end result. This is the same process that we follow for our clients, so we thought it might be interesting for you to see behind the scenes of how a new brand identity is developed.</description>

      <description>This extremely irritating email error message seems to have been plaguing several of our clients recently, so I thought it was worth writing this post to provide some solutions to the problem.
I don&amp;rsquo;t usually write technical posts, but this particular problem has cropped up a number of times and I thought it was worth putting something on our blog to help out anyone else who might be tearing their hair out to try and get it resolved.</description>
