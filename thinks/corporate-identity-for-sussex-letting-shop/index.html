<p>When we got a call from Wendy at Geneva Investment Group in Hove asking about designing a new website, little did we know that we would be helping them shape their corporate identity as well&hellip;</p>

<p>In October 2012, we received an email from Wendy at Geneva Investment Group asking us to talk to them about designing and developing a new website for them.  Geneva Investment Group is one of the biggest private landlords in Brighton and Hove in Sussex.  At the time, they had no website and their marketing was done via local newspaper advertising on a property-by-property basis.</p>

<h2 id="choosing-a-name">Choosing a name</h2>

<p>We arranged to meet and during our discussions it soon became apparent that they also needed our help in establishing a corporate identity or <a href="/creates/brand/">brand</a>.  It was apparent that they needed to be able to present a more traditional high street estate agent image that could then be rolled out across their online marketing and website.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Having approached Polis Paralela for web site design we realised from our first meeting that they were very capable of offering an extremely broad and full spectrum of services which we have taken full advantage of including branding, stationery design, web hosting, PDF document designs for downloads and the launching of our first web site.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A lot of Geneva&rsquo;s tenants are - how can we put it nicely - operating at the lower end of the property ladder, and the name for the new brand needed to suit its target market.  Geneva settled on the name Sussex Letting Shop and we started to create a corporate identity for them.</p>

<h2 id="1-graphic-device">1. Graphic device</h2>

<p>The first step in the process was to consider a graphic device the brand - what would commonly be referred to as &ldquo;the logo&rdquo;.  In some corporate identities, there is no graphic device and the brand is just how the name is styled; think Cadbury, Sky, Samsung or perhaps the best known of all - Coca Cola.</p>

<p>For Sussex Letting Shop we wanted to include a graphic device and researched some simple symbolic shapes that might work.  The rather obvious one was a simplistic house shape, but this was used quite widely within the industry. However, it did lead us to look at simplifying further, and this developed into a roof shape that could form the lower part of the &ldquo;x&rdquo; in &ldquo;Sussex&rdquo;.</p>

<p><img src="images/blog/graphicdevice.jpg" alt="" title="Deciding on a graphic device" /></p>

<h2 id="2-typeface">2. Typeface</h2>

<p>Next up was the typeface for the corporate identity - the font style for the words of the brand.  After much research, we developed a bespoke font which has a confident and strong feel to it, without being elitest or aloof - again referring back to the brief.</p>

<p>Next we looked at uppercase versus lowercase and agreed that uppercase was a little intimidating for the main name, but worked nicely for the word &ldquo;shop&rdquo;.</p>

<p><img src="images/blog/typeface.jpg" alt="" title="A bespoke typeface was created" /></p>

<h2 id="3-positioning">3. Positioning</h2>

<p>The positioning of the words was important to the overall balance of the corporate identity and we looked at lots of alternative positions for the different words within the name, finally settling on a horizontal orientation, with the &ldquo;Sussex&rdquo; and &ldquo;Letting&rdquo; in lowercase running alongside one another (with the lower part of the &ldquo;x&rdquo; using the roof graphic) and the word &ldquo;shop&rdquo; running vertically at the right hand end.</p>

<h2 id="4-colours">4. Colours</h2>

<p>The last stage of the process was to look at colours for the corporate id.  After much research, our design team put forward three suggested colours; a medium blue, a limey green and a purple.</p>

<p>When we discussed the colours with the client, the blue was considered a little cold and so it was decided that it didn&rsquo;t fit the brief.  The green was popular because of its striking funky feel, but the purple won out as it was considered the most friendly, approachable and professional looking.</p>

<p>Colour can play a huge part in how people percieve your brand.  This article called <a href="http://www.usabilitypost.com/2008/09/29/a-guide-to-choosing-colors-for-your-brand/">A guide to choosing colours for your brand</a> provides an interesting insight into what each colour can mean to your customers.</p>

<p><img src="images/blog/colourssussexletting.jpg" alt="" title="Three colours were put forward. Purple was chosen" /></p>

<h2 id="5-in-situ">5. In situ</h2>

<p>With any corporate identity, it&rsquo;s vital that it works in all the situations in which it might be used.</p>

<p>Does it work on large signage (in particular in this instance on To Let boards)? What about in monochrome for newspaper ads?  Does it work when it is reduced down to a very small size?</p>

<p>If it doesn&rsquo;t work in any of these circumstances, it&rsquo;s not fitting the brief.</p>

<p>We always pay particular attention to this important step in the process of creating a corporate identity and we were able to demonstrate to the client that we had thoroughly investigated all this for them and were satisfied that it worked in all these situations.</p>

<h2 id="the-result">The result</h2>

<p><img src="images/blog/finalidentity.jpg" alt="" title="The final corporate identity" /></p>

<p>The client is delighted with the end result and is really pleased with how it has been rolled out across their business stationery and website.  It has achieved the goal of positioning and differentiating their business in a competitive marketplace and we look forward to working with them in the future as they enjoy further success.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;As novices with regards to web site concept and operation we are now fully trained and conversant with all the tools we need to take our business forward and compete with others in the same market.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The team at Polis Paralela has been a pleasure to work with and we have all learnt so much. We would have no hesitation in recommending their services.&ldquo;.</p>
