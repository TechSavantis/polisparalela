<p>Writing copy for your website is hard. Writing <em>good</em> copy is even harder.</p>

<p>A common misconception about writing good copy is that it must be lavish, flowing and full of impressive words; and many writers find this prospect intimidating.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The best copy is easy to read</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But it turns out that if you want your copy to be more widely read - by more people and in more detail - you need to simplify it.</p>

<p>You need to write like you&rsquo;re writing for a nine year old.</p>

<p>In a wonderful bit of analysis by <a href="http://shanesnow.contently.com/">Shane Snow at Contently</a>, he establishes that the most popular authors consistently write for a lower <em>reading age level</em>.</p>

<p>There are lots of formulas for measuring the &ldquo;reading level&rdquo; of written work, and Shane uses the most common of these, which is called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch%E2%80%93Kincaid_readability_tests">Flesch-Kincaid</a> test.</p>

<p>He ran a whole load of well known books through the test, and found some very <a href="http://contently.com/strategist/2015/01/28/this-surprising-reading-level-analysis-will-change-the-way-you-write/">interesting results</a>.</p>

<p>Shane says in his blog post that &ldquo;This&hellip;Analysis Will Change The Way You Write&rdquo; - and it certainly has for me.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to share with you <em>my</em> understanding of the analysis and how I&rsquo;ve applied it to my copywriting.</p>

<h2 id="an-explanation-of-the-analysis">An explanation of the analysis</h2>

<p>The Flesch-Kincaid test is a formula that calculates very quickly the &ldquo;reading level&rdquo; of any piece of written work, whether it&rsquo;s a short chapter in a book or a 1000-word report.</p>

<p><img src="images/blog/29a1072-1024x625.jpg" alt="" title="Reading level of bestselling authors books - Copyright Shane Snow" /></p>

<p>It works this out from the number of syllables in the words, the length of sentences and lots of other stuff including how complicated the vocabulary is and gives it a score in line with the school reading age that would be able to understand it.</p>

<p>For instance, a score of 7.9 means you&rsquo;d need an 8th-grade (13-14 years old) reading level to be able to understand it. Or 8 years of school reading education (after kindergarten/reception class).</p>

<p>A score of 4 means you&rsquo;d need a 4th grade (9-10 years old) reading level.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-should-be-aiming-for">What you should be aiming for</h2>

<p>Shane was dismayed to find his own writing scored 7.9 - so he went off and compared various famous authors to see what scores they got.</p>

<p>What he found - somewhat to his surprise, he admits - was all the most popular authors scored <em>low</em> on this test, suggesting that if you want your writing to be popular and more widely shared, make it <em>easier to read</em>.</p>

<p><img src="images/blog/lower-reading-level.jpg" alt="" title="The most popular authors can be read and understood by 9 year-olds" /></p>

<h2 id="why-this-is-important-to-your-customers">Why this is important to your customers</h2>

<p>But you&rsquo;re not aiming at children right?</p>

<p>Well&hellip;</p>

<p>In 2003, a survey showed 15% of UK adults (that&rsquo;s 5.1 million people) had the reading level of an 11 year old. What&rsquo;s more, we tend to &ldquo;read down&rdquo; a level when we&rsquo;re reading online - because we scan text quickly looking for the information we want, and tend to have shorter concentration spans.</p>

<p><em>Your</em> audience will appreciate you writing like they&rsquo;re 9 years old.</p>

<h3 id="people-will-stick-around-and-read-what-you-ve-written">People will stick around and read what you&rsquo;ve written</h3>

<p>If you want to persuade a customer to buy your products instead of those of your competitors, you need to be able to hold their attention and get your message across quickly.</p>

<h3 id="people-are-more-likely-to-share-your-content">People are more likely to share your content</h3>

<p>Your content gets a wider audience when it&rsquo;s share across social media.</p>

<p>Writing simply will increase the chances of this happening. Readers want information they can digest quickly.</p>

<h3 id="you-can-turn-more-visitors-to-subscribers-or-customers">You can turn more visitors to subscribers or customers</h3>

<p>How often have you stopped reading a web page part way through because it was just <em>such hard work?</em></p>

<p>I bet you didn&rsquo;t hang around to do anything else either, like buy something or sign up to an email list. Who&rsquo;s going to sign up to receive <em>even more</em> of this stuff?</p>

<p>This is why you should invest a little bit of time in making your copy as readable as possible.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-become-a-better-writer">How to become a better writer</h2>

<p>So you understand <em>why</em> you should do it - but what about <em>how</em> you do it?</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s three things you can do to make your writing better:</p>

<h3 id="1-use-shorter-sentences">1. Use shorter sentences</h3>

<p>The first thing you can do to make your writing easier to read is to make your sentences shorter. Much shorter.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s look at an example of how I did this on the new Polis Paralela site.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the original copy from the <a href="/creates/brand/">Brand</a> page;</p>

<p><img src="images/blog/Brand-copy-version-1.jpg" alt="" title="Original copy" /></p>

<p>The first sentence is fine. The second sentence sucks. The third sentence had potential but felt a bit clumsy.</p>

<p>The second paragraph also has issues; the first sentence is ok but needed some refinement. The second sentence just doesn&rsquo;t know when to quit.</p>

<p>I re-worked this whole passage and came up with the following, which I was much happier with:</p>

<p><img src="images/blog/Brand-copy-version-2.jpg" alt="" title="Edited copy. Much better..." /></p>

<p>Much shorter sentences. Much less work.</p>

<h3 id="2-change-clever-words-for-simpler-ones">2. Change clever words for simpler ones</h3>

<p>The next thing I did was to see where I could replace a word with something simpler that meant the same thing, and didn&rsquo;t negatively impact on the overall tone.</p>

<p>For example, this original paragraph was taken from the <a href="/creates/web/">Web design</a> page:</p>

<p><img src="images/blog/Web-design-copy-version-1.jpg" alt="" title="Original copy" /></p>

<p>I changed this to:</p>

<p><img src="images/blog/Web-design-copy-version-2.jpg" alt="" title="Edited copy - much simpler..." /></p>

<p>And this passage, taken from the <a href="/creates/web/">Ecommerce</a> page:</p>

<p><img src="images/blog/Ecommerce-copy-version-1.jpg" alt="" title="Original copy" /></p>

<p>Was replaced with:</p>

<p><img src="images/blog/Ecommerce-copy-version-2.jpg" alt="" title="Edited copy" /></p>

<h3 id="3-make-your-copy-more-conversational">3. Make your copy more conversational</h3>

<p>How often have you seen a piece of copy that looks something like this:</p>

<p><strong>You will be suitably impressed with all the members of our customer services team. They are all trained to an exceptional standard so you will always feel well looked after.</strong></p>

<p>Read the passage out loud (or quietly to yourself if you&rsquo;re in an open plan office). Do you sound like a robot?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a common trap to fall into, and comes from the speed you type compared to the speed you think and talk.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s my top tips for making your copy more conversational:</p>

<h4 id="1-apostrophise-made-up-word">1. Apostrophise (made up word?)</h4>

<p>Go through your work and look for all instances where you can use an apostrophe to make the tone more informal. Change &ldquo;we are&rdquo; to &ldquo;we&rsquo;re&rdquo;, &ldquo;you will&rdquo; to &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll&rdquo; and so on. Be careful how far you go; &ldquo;it&rsquo;ll&rdquo; is on the border for me and something like &ldquo;our team&rsquo;ll&rdquo; is clearly a shooting offence.</p>

<h4 id="2-eliminate-that">2. Eliminate &ldquo;that&rdquo;</h4>

<p>I often see unnecessary uses of &ldquo;that&rdquo; and &ldquo;it&rdquo;, when you can remove them to keep the same meaning, but it sounds much more conversational. For example:</p>

<p><strong>It is best to post between 6-11pm, as this is when there is the largest amount of users active on Facebook. This means that your post is going to be seen by more people and get a higher reach.</strong></p>

<p>Take out the &ldquo;that&rdquo; and it still makes sense, but sounds more conversational:</p>

<p><strong>It is best to post between 6-11pm, as this is when there is the largest amount of users active on Facebook. This means your post is going to be seen by more people and get a higher reach.</strong></p>

<h2 id="when-it-s-not-appropriate-to-dumb-down">When it&rsquo;s not appropriate to dumb down</h2>

<p>Finally, a word of caution.</p>

<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s not appropriate to simplify.</p>

<p>Be careful if you&rsquo;re writing a &ldquo;How to&hellip;&rdquo; guide that your flowing copy doesn&rsquo;t leave any room for confusion. Nobody will thank you if they flood their house because of a badly used apostrophe.</p>

<p>The same goes for technical pieces, for the same reason.</p>

<p>But don&rsquo;t forget - no matter who your writing&rsquo;s aimed at, everyone appreciates copy that&rsquo;s as readable as possible.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Writing good copy makes the difference between winning or losing customers. We love helping our clients become winners.</p>
